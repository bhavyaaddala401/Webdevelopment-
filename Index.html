   <center> <h1> AVOID SUGARY FOOD  </h1> 
   
    
    <h3> Sugary foods and drinks <br>

Overall, the problem with too much sugar is that it tends to mean your diet will be high in calories (energy) and this can lead to putting on weight. Excess weight increases the chances of developing type 2 diabetes and heart and circulatory diseases.<br>

Not all foods containing sugars are the same. Fruit or dairy products contain natural sugars but are nutritious foods that contain vitamins, minerals and in some cases fibre.<br>

What we need to cut down on are free sugars, which include added sugars, syrups, or juices. They’re “free” because they’re not naturally within the food, either because they’re added, or they’re released from the cells of fruit when it’s cooked, or when it’s processed into juices, smoothies and purees. It’s recommended that we eat less than 30g (1oz) of free sugars each day, but most of us are eating more than this.                                                                                                   </h3></center>
